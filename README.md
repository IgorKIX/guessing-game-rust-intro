# guessing-game-rust-intro
## Introduction
I think that first programming language which I met was a C++. Yeah some may say that this sounds like a rough introduction but back then I felt quite good in spite of all difficulties associated with strongly typed languages. 

Still I feel some kind of longing when I see that `""` & `''` doesn't stands for string and char (respectively). Even typescript couldn't feel this void, cause it still was more of pretending and making up for what lower level languages offered.

So the time has come to get hands dirt again in types and references. Rust looks like a good opportunity for that matter. 'Community driven' is just a cherry on top.

## Description
This code was made with big help from a legendary [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) :wink: 
I'm just trying to use the newest version of dependencies & Rust to make it a little harder and get used to the style of documentation.

You won't be surprised, it's just an good old guessing game. The program draws a number and a player's goal is to guess it, with a little help from a program that tells whether the number given by the player was to big or to small.

To make it easier for you I moved the release file to `/release` folder, so you don't have to trouble yourself with getting cargo and compiling :wink:

So start your terminal and go to the `/release` dir of the project and run the file by `./guessing_game` command to see how this works.

## Dependencies
rand 0.8.3
